# UCI Downhill results analysis in R

This is my final semestral assignment for the course 'Data analysis in R for practical use' I took in autumn 2022 at Masaryk University. As a fan of MTB and downhill in particular, I often watch live streams of ‘The Mercedes-Benz UCI Mountain Bike World Cup’. During one race last season, it was raining heavily and one of the commentators said that rides from Scotland usually finish better in bad weather, because it rains a lot in Scotland and they are used to it. And this is the hypothesis I’ve decided to test.

## Result
